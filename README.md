# Employee Management Dashboard: .NET Core 7 Web Api + NUXT 3 + tailwind with Flowbite

## Description

Another project to add to my full stack learning journey. A small and basic .NET Core 7 Web API Employee Management Dashboard. You can perform CRUD operations on Employees and Department. Each Employee can only be part of one department.

## Prerequisites

   The API will be accessible at `https://localhost:7244`.
